*ALGORITHMS*  are finite sequence of [well-defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined "Well-defined"), computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.[Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm#cite_note-1) are always [unambiguous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unambiguous "Unambiguous") and are used as specifications for performing [calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation "Calculation"), [data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing "Data processing"), [automated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning "Automated reasoning"), and other tasks.[Visit this link for more info on algorithms on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)

*ALGORITHMS-TS* is a set of algorithms based on the Open Source Community written in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and can be integrated and implemented in projects to help with faster development.
